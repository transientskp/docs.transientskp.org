:Last updated: |last_updated|

This documentation is by necessity largely hand-edited.  Coupled with the
current rate of developmental change, this often results in rather out of date
docs.

In their current state `(26/09/12)`, these docs give a reasonable overview
of the features available from the Trap and its component parts, but are
often somewhat outdated when it comes to the details.

If in doubt, look for a "`Last updated:`" note below the title.  If it's not
there, you should assume the docs refer to the state of the code prior to
September 2012. (Or better yet, refer to the source!)

Happy Trapping!
